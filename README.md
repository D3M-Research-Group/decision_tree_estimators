# Decision Tree Estimators

A package for tree-based statistical estimation and inference. Trees provides implementations of StrongTrees, FairTrees, RobustTrees, and Prescriptive Trees for classification.

## Documentation

The [package documentation](https://d3m-research-group.github.io/decision_tree_estimators/index.html) contains usage examples and method reference.

## Installation

The current development version can be installed from source with the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/patrickvossler18/decision_tree_estimators.git#egg=trees
```

A release version of the package will be available on PyPI shortly.
