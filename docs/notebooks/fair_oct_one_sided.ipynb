    "The figure below shows a simplified version of the class structure for optimal classification trees with fairness constraints. The `ConstrainedOCT` class includes an abstract method `_define_side_constraints()` which will be added to the optimization problem on top of the tree structure, flow, and arc constraints declared by the `FlowOCTMultipleSink` class. The `FairConstrainedOCT` class provides a method for adding a two-sided fairness constraint and the classes that inherit from it contain methods calculating the particular fairness notion of interest. However, for our example, we want a one-sided bound instead of a two-sided bound. In other words, we want the difference between two groups to not exceed a desired value rather than be bounded in absolute value."

While it is likely feasible to modify the `FairConstrainedOCT` class to allow users to specify whether they want a one-sided or two-sided fairness constraint when they initialize one of the four different `Fair*OCT` classes, such an approach leads to duplicated code and increased code complexity which makes future modifications to the code more complicated."
