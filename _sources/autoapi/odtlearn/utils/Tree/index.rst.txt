=============================

.. py:module:: odtlearn.utils.Tree

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   In this class we create a structure to hold the classification/regression tree.
   We need following requirements:
       0- An easy way for user to create the tree
       1- The set of branching nodes
       2- The set of Leaves
       3- For each node we need to get the index of left/right children and the parent
   In this class we assume that we have a complete binary tree; we only receive the depth from the user
