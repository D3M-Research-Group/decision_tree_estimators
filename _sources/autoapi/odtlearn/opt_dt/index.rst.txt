.. py:class:: OptimalDecisionTree(solver, depth=1, time_limit=60, num_threads=None, verbose=False)


   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   
   An abstract base class for learning optimal decision trees using mixed-integer programming.


   :Parameters:

       **solver** : str
           The solver to use for the MIP formulation. Currently, only "gurobi" and "CBC" are supported.

       **depth** : int, default=1
           The maximum depth of the tree to be learned.

       **time_limit** : int, default=60
           The time limit (in seconds) for solving the MIP formulation.

       **num_threads** : int, optional
           The number of threads the solver should use. If not specified,
           solver uses all available threads

       **verbose** : bool, default=False
           Whether to print verbose output from the solver.









   .. rubric:: Notes

   This is an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated directly.
   Subclasses must implement the following abstract methods:

   * `_define_variables()`
   * `_define_constraints()`
   * `_define_objective()`
   * `fit()`
   * `predict()`



   :Attributes:

       **solver_name** : str
           The name of the solver being used.

       **optim_gap** : float
           The optimality gap considering the cost of the best solution found.

       **objective_value** : float
           The objective function value of the solution found or None if the model was not optimized.

       **objective_bound** : float
           A valid estimate computed for the optimal solution cost. The bound is equal to the objective
           value if the optimal solution is found.

       **num_decision_vars** : int
           The number of decision variables in the model.

       **num_integer_vars** : int
           The number of integer variables in the model.

       **num_non_zero** : int
           The number of non-zeros in the constraint matrix.

       **num_solutions** : int
           The number of solutions found during the optimization.

       **num_constraints** : int
           The number of constraints in the model.

       **search_progress_log** : mip.ProgressLog
           The log of bound improvements during the optimization.

       **store_search_progress_log** : bool
           Whether the search progress log should be stored or not.
